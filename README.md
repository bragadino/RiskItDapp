# RiskItDapp
An Ethereum Based ERC20 Team Game - Ropsten Testnet live at https://risk-it-dapp.herokuapp.com/

## Gameplay
RiskIt is a team based game. Players begin playing by selecting a team (Red or Blue). Players then purchase tokens and "Risk" them. The team who risks the most tokens in each game period is the winner. The loosing teams tokens are then split proportionally between the winning teams players who risked tokens that round. The winning team then gets a point for winning. This continues round by round, and
players can buy in at any time as long as there are still tokens to purchase.
