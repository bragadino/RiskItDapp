  <h1>FAQS</h1><br>
  <div class=default_box>
    <h3> How do I play? </h3>
    <p> To play risk, you simply need to register - here you will choose your side and purchase some tokens. These tokens are used during
      gameplay for you to "battle" the other team. The team who risks the most tokens each round is that rounds winner!. </p>
    <p> The winner of each round gets their tokens returned to them, and 50% of the other teams risked tokens. The other 50% of the tokens
      are burned - lowering the total supply of RSK tokens and making them even more valuable! In the event of a tie, all tokens are burn - a costly
      event. </p>
    <p> Now onto some game specifics. First of all, each round runs for 7 days. After a round has ended, a user has the entire next round to claim their winnings
    if their team came out ontop. If you dont do this within the round, your tokens will be lost (So be sure to check back if you have made a risk!)</p>

  <h3> Will the token be listed on an exchange? </h3>
  <p> Since tokens can be brought from the contract for a flat price of 1000RSK = 1ETH, initially the tokens wont be listed on an exhange.
    The initial total supply of tokens is 100,000 (or 100 ETH worth), If this total initial supply is all purchased from the contract, then
     the tokens may be listed on an exhange to allow new players to continually enter the game. </p>
  </div>

  <div class=default_box>
  <h3> Can I send my RSK tokens to my friends? </h3>
  <p>  You sure can! RSK tokens are ERC20 compliant and can be used with all major wallets. Send them to your mates or invite them to come play!</p>

  <h3> What is the point of RiskIt? </h3>
  <p> The game was designed as a proof of concept for how team games could potentially be played on the Ethereum blockchain. I thought it would be a fun
  project to bring together the Ethereum community. It is meant to be a game accessible to everyone (you dont need to spend hundreds of dollars to play), and once
  that doesnt require much attention. You can simply Risk your tokens any time during a round and come back when its over.</p>
